# KATAS

Repository where I make small katas in Java, for playful and educational purposes.

I have currently performed the following Katas:

- **Word counter**: From a text, return a map with the number of times each word is repeated.
- **Roman Numbers**: From a number, it returns its equivalent in Roman numerals
- **Palindrome**: From a word, it tells you if it is a palindrome word or not
- **Draw**: Allows you to draw a square or a rectangle with asterisks
